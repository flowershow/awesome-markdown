### Obsidian Quartz

> [!note]
> In 2023 think Quartz updated to be JS based (and even NextJS based?)

 https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz 609 ⭐

> "Hosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use _free_ tools to publish that garden to the world. ... **The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet."
